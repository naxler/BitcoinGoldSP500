# BitcoinGoldSP500
I'm a lawyer trying to learn programming.  This is incomplete code for an app showing BTC price against other assets.  It does show the BTC price but I had trouble finding a free gold API.  My main goal was to learn to access APIs with Axios and this seems to have accomplished that.  If I find some time, I'll retun and try to improve this:)
